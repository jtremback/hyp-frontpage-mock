          We think relatively simple tools can help us all improve the quality of information on the Internet, and by extension in the greater world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hypothes.is will be a distributed, open-source platform for the collaborative evaluation of information. It will enable sentence-level critique of written words combined with a sophisticated yet easy-to-use model of community peer-review. It will work as an overlay on top of any stable content, including news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and regulations, software code and more-without requiring participation of the underlying site.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is based on a new draft standard for annotating digital documents currently being developed by the
          <a href='http://openannotation.org'>Open Annotation Collaboration</a>,
          a consortium that includes the Internet Archive, NISO (National Information Standards Organization), O'Reilly Books, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and a number of academic institutions.

          <p>One of the most important parts of our design is the reputation model that will underpin the system. A reputation model is a way for a user community to collectively regulate and calibrate the contributions of its members. This is a well-established field of study, encompassing many years of academic research and with numerous examples of working systems deployed in the real world.</p>
          <p>Thanks to a generous grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation we hosted a Workshop on February 22-24, 2012 in San Francisco at the Fort Mason Center, in order to share with and learn from key members of the academic, non-profit, and commercial sectors who research and use reputation systems.</p>

            <h4>Why will this project succeed? Haven't there been other efforts like this before?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>No one has yet made an effective attempt to leverage the strengths of the Internet to improve the quality of information we consume, at the place that we consume it. In essence, we are bringing crowd-sourced peer-review to the event horizon where information is produced - the millions of websites on the Internet. To encourage quality, we will employ a reputation framework.</div>

            <h4>Doesn't this require the contribution of a large number of people to succeed? How do you create that at the outset?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>This is true of any large community site or marketplace. Ebay, Craigslist, Yelp, Match.com and any site that relies on "network effect" faces the same catch-22 at launch: the utility of the service only happens after a certain scale.</p>
              <p>Here are three approaches we propose to solve this problem-</p>
              <ol>
                <li>create a tool that's useful even before the larger community arrives.</li>
                <li>engage pools of domain experts that are willing to help jump start quality analysis.</li>
                <li>drive sufficient traffic to create critical mass. We have considerable expertise in these areas and will pursue these strategies as well as others in order to get the job done.</li>

            <h4>Do you really think that people have the disposition, patience, or qualifications to participate in this way?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>Yes, we do. Think of Wikipedia. Most of us have never edited a single Wikipedia entry yet we read tens or even hundreds of them a month. 1% is the number frequently quoted as the ratio between contributors and consumers in that community. Frankly, we're surprised it's that high, and we think we can easily survive on that ratio. Also, using Hypothes.is will be substantially easier than editing a Wikipedia page, so we expect (but don't need) participation from a higher percentage of readers than other tools.</div>

            <h4>This seems like a never-ending challenge; will we ever stem the tide of lousy information?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>If what is published is immediately fact and logic-checked, in a detailed and highly visible way, it will necessarily put pressure upstream to the point of authorship. In order to accomplish this we need better feedback mechanisms. Standard comments just aren't up to the task, and neither are newer systems such as Disqus, IntenseDebate, Facebook Comments or others. While interesting, none of them fundamentally change the comment model. It's time for a new set of tools.</p>
              <p>We don't expect perfection. Human affairs are a messy business. We do think things can be substantially improved.</p>

            <h4>Won't people try to game the system?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>Yes, we are certain they will. It's part of human nature. In fact, the more effective the system, the more sophisticated we expect the attempts to game it will be. Minimizing and monitoring for gaming over the long-term are primary design considerations. Reputation in distributed systems is a mature field of study. Algorithms and social approaches to maximize trust even where little is initially known about participants and their contributions are numerous and diverse. Some of the world's experts in this field are among the team members and advisors.</p>

            <h4>What's the incentive for any site to add this feature?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>We don't expect or need sites to enable this functionality. The system will use a range of interfaces, including a browser plug-in, URL shorteners, a destination site and other approaches to wrap existing web content with our toolkit. We'll also publish an API for third party developers and websites. In the future, mobile apps will also be developed for iphone, ipad and android devices.</p>

            <h4>Why will people download your plug-in?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>They won't be required to download the plug-in, though they will have to in order to participate most completely as editors. Because we'll offer the capability through multiple means, users will initially be able to experience Hypothes.is first just by following a link. Also, keep in mind, with newer browser versions, installing plug-ins has become as fast and easy as clicking a link - usually no restart of the browser is even required. People download apps for their smart phones every day, so we think getting people to install a plug-in to their browser is more a function of messaging and creating the right value proposition than anything else.</p>

              <p>We don't pledge allegiance to a political party, nor are we advocates for a particular political philosophy. Hypothes.is is explicitly non-partisan, recognizing that people of all nations and all political perspectives have a need for trust-worthy information in their civic and personal lives. While some web content relates to politics, most does not. Hypothes.is is about encouraging fact-based discussion and robust analysis across a wide variety of subjects.</p>

            <h4>Why a non-profit?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>Many have observed over the last few centuries that it is difficult to preserve journalistic objectivity over a long time period as a commercial enterprise. As serial entrepreneurs, we are particularly well aware of the pressures on high-tech commercial enterprises to generate profits for investors - and the difficulty, or impossibility, of preserving the original goals of a project under these expectations. As a result, we think Hypothes.is is best-suited to fulfill its mission as a non-profit social enterprise, to ensure the long-term focus on its founding mission. We will employ a mix of best of class practices from this evolving class of enterprises to ensure long term revenue and sustainability.</p>

            <h4>Why "Hypothes.is"?</h4>
            <div class='collapsee'>
              <p>A thesis is the foundation upon which any persuasive argument rests - namely, that which you seek to prove. It is the first thing you should start with when writing, and the first thing you should look for when reading. A hypothesis is a thesis in the form of a proposed explanation for some observable phenomenon. It embodies two key characteristics essential to the discovery of new knowledge - curiosity and humility. A hypothesis changes into a thesis when supported by facts and evidence. Hypothes.is will provide a toolkit to help you assess whether the theses you read on the web are supported by facts and evidence.</p>
              <p>You might have noticed the odd .is at the end of our name. It's the two letter internet code for the nation of Iceland. While we've used this as a handy way to spell the word "Hypothesis" (a technique known as domain hacking), we also think the Icelandic people are great representatives of the kind of thinking we're trying to nurture. In 2010, Iceland's parliament passed the forward-looking Modern Media Initiative, creating a process through which 13 separate laws will be edited with the aim of establishing strong protections for the freedom of information, speech and expression. The protections contemplated would be among the most advanced in the world. Also, Iceland has recently undertaken the process of crowdsourcing a rewrite of their constitution. We approve!</p>

        <h4>by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</h4>

      <h4>Part I</h4>
      <p>
        It is an ancient Mariner,<br>And he stoppeth one of three.<br>`By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br>Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
      </p>
      <p>
        The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<br>And I am next of kin;<br>The guests are met, the feast is set:<br>Mayst hear the merry din.'
      </p>
      <p>
        He holds him with his skinny hand,<br>"There was a ship," quoth he.<br>`Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'<br>Eftsoons his hand dropped he.
      </p>
      <p>
        He holds him with his glittering eye - <br>The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br>And listens like a three years' child:<br>The Mariner hath his will.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<br>He cannot choose but hear;<br>And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>The bright-eyed Mariner.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br>Merrily did we drop<br>Below the kirk, below the hill,<br>Below the lighthouse top.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sun came up upon the left,<br>Out of the sea came he!<br>And he shone bright, and on the right<br>Went down into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Higher and higher every day,<br>Till over the mast at noon -"<br>The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br>For he heard the loud bassoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bride hath paced into the hall,<br>Red as a rose is she;<br>Nodding their heads before her goes<br>The merry minstrelsy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br>Yet he cannot choose but hear;<br>And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>The bright-eyed Mariner.
      </p>
      <p>
        "And now the storm-blast came, and he<br>Was tyrannous and strong:<br>He struck with his o'ertaking wings,<br>And chased us south along.
      </p>
      <p>
        With sloping masts and dipping prow,<br>As who pursued with yell and blow<br>Still treads the shadow of his foe,<br>And foward bends his head,<br>The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<br>And southward aye we fled.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now there came both mist and snow,<br>And it grew wondrous cold:<br>And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br>As green as emerald.
      </p>
      <p>
        And through the drifts the snowy clifts<br>Did send a dismal sheen:<br>Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken - <br>The ice was all between.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ice was here, the ice was there,<br>The ice was all around:<br>It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br>Like noises in a swound!
      </p>
      <p>
        At length did cross an Albatross,<br>Thorough the fog it came;<br>As it had been a Christian soul,<br>We hailed it in God's name.
      </p>
      <p>
        It ate the food it ne'er had eat,<br>And round and round it flew.<br>The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br>The helmsman steered us through!
      </p>
      <p>
        And a good south wind sprung up behind;<br>The Albatross did follow,<br>And every day, for food or play,<br>Came to the mariner's hollo!
      </p>
      <p>
        In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br>It perched for vespers nine;<br>Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br>Glimmered the white moonshine."
      </p>
      <p>
        `God save thee, ancient Mariner,<br>From the fiends that plague thee thus! - <br>Why look'st thou so?' -"With my crossbow<br>I shot the Albatross."

  <h1 class='sectitle'>The Robust Anchoring Challenge</h1>
  <div class='row'>
    <div class='one_whole'>
      <p>
        A $10,000 contest to solicit, identify and implement strategies that propose innovative long-term robust inter- and intra-document text anchors which function effectively on the diversity of content and formats across the web.
      </p>
      <h3>Challenge Background</h3>
      <p>Hypertext links generally point to the top of documents and other web-connected media.  Intra-document anchors exist, but these usually are established at fixed places by the author of the original document, and are not useful for others in pointing to arbitrary locations in documents they do not create.</p>
      <p>Recently, annotation has emerged as an important new way for others to point into things and contribute independent thinking and other kinds of useful information.  Central to the success and interoperability of annotation standards such as Open Annotation (openannotation.org) is the adoption of a long-term, stable approach (or possibly approaches) to anchoring annotations by selecting fragments that are robust against changes over time in the underlying document.   This is referred to as intra-document anchoring.</p>
      <p>A related, but different problem is that often documents exist in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, etc), or may be accessible in paginated or unpaginated versions.  It would be helpful if an annotation created in one would also be automatically visible in the other.  Also, often the same or nearly the same content (for instance with line numbers in one place, but without in another) may be available in many places (e.g. The Bible, Shakespeare, US constitution, popular song lyrics, news stories, or other examples of widely disseminated information).  Should we seek ways of enabling the shared annotation of these type of documents wherever they exist?  This class of problems collectively are referred to as inter-document anchoring or also content-based anchoring (aka the content addressable web).</p>
      <h3>Solve It!</h3>
      <p>Over the years there have been a range of suggested solutions to some or all of these problems, ranging from XPointer (XPath) to the <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/">NY Times’ Emphasis project.</a>  (We’ve included a reading list at the end)  Also, importantly, some have proposed strategies for how to combine solutions with a confidence metric for whether the anchor is still valid, depending on minor or major changes in the underlying document, and how to fail gracefully if the anchor can no longer be reliably matched.</p>
      <p>We acknowledge the wide range of previous work in this field over the past decades, and we can imagine using a variety of existing strategies in combination to provide a robust solution to these problems.  We can also envision generalized approaches that try to solve intra- and inter-document challenges simultaneously (for instance by using content hashes).   Proposers are free to tackle any of the above, either singly, or in combination.</p>
      <p>What we’re sure of is that a) this is a problem that many have thought about for much longer than we have, b) that this is a grand challenge that many need solved, and c) this is a perfect opportunity to bring these twin forces together.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>Ours is an open-source, non-profit effort.   Proposers commit in advance that all strategies and algorithms will be donated to the public domain in perpetuity without restriction, for the benefit of humanity, and released as open source software via github (or another similar open source repository).  Also, all proposers agree that their submissions (winning or not) can be made public in the original form they provide.</p>
      <p>Please submit a summary of your proposal in a one-page executive summary, as well as a longer form description as necessary.  Also, implementations in code form (Javascript for instance) are strongly encouraged.</p>
      <p>Please be sure to place your proposal in the context of the prior work that has come in this space.</p>
      <h3>Peer-review</h3>
      <p>Proposers also should indicate whether they would be willing to participate in a peer-review process, by reviewing a number of (for instance, five) randomly selected other proposals, selecting one or more to go on to the next stage.  This is optional and will not affect your proposal.</p>
      <h3>Judging</h3>
      <p>Winning submissions will ultimately be selected by a panel of judges as well as ourselves.  We may select a number of different proposals that taken together represent the best overall approach.</p>
      <p>Winners should be willing to work together to produce a revised, comprehensive algorithm and overall strategy which can be implemented in code.  It is our hope, but not a requirement, that those individuals might become long term contributors to this effort.</p>
      <p>Winners are also strongly encouraged to publish their work separately.</p>
      <h3>Considerations</h3>
      <p>
        The best strategies may have some of the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul class='list'>
        <li>They are conceptually and architecturally simple.</li>
        <li>They are built with an eye towards the future.  What is likely to remain constant over time?  Can we imagine the same approach working 100 years from now?  (A good question is: What has remained relatively stable in the past?)</li>
        <li>They are able to be implemented now-- they don’t depend on new technologies or standards yet to come.</li>
        <li>They acknowledge that because of the inherent instability of web content, anchors can never be known for certain, and we may take different actions based on how confident we are.</li>
        <li>They outline how we fail gracefully when we cannot reattach anchors.</li>
        <li>New anchors can be determined solely from information available on the document to which they refer.</li>
        <li>They are not expensive to compute on a per instance basis.</li>
        <li>Queries to see whether annotations exist for a given anchor would not require excessive bandwidth or complex multipart negotiations w/ remote services.  (Simple, short / fast queries are ok).</li>
        <li>They contemplate the diversity of text content and formats, including the lowest common denominator problem-- in other words some pages are highly structured (and that structure can be traversed to efficiently rediscover things that have moved), but some pages are not.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deadline: October 31, 2012</h3>
      <p>Submissions will be accepted through October 31, 2012.  Once submissions have been received, we will review them internally, and depending on volume, may request that proposers assist in the initial peer review phase.  Screening and judging will be completed by November 30, 2102.</p>
      <h3>Prize: $10,000</h3>
      <p>A $10,000 prize will be split evenly amongst no more than three winners.  The funding for this prize is part of an overall grant that Hypothes.is received from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</p>
