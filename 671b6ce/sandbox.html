              <h4>by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</h4>

            <h4>Part I</h4>
            <p>
              It is an ancient Mariner,<br>And he stoppeth one of three.<br>`By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br>Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
            </p>
            <p>
              The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<br>And I am next of kin;<br>The guests are met, the feast is set:<br>Mayst hear the merry din.'
            </p>
            <p>
              He holds him with his skinny hand,<br>"There was a ship," quoth he.<br>`Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'<br>Eftsoons his hand dropped he.
            </p>
            <p>
              He holds him with his glittering eye - <br>The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br>And listens like a three years' child:<br>The Mariner hath his will.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<br>He cannot choose but hear;<br>And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>The bright-eyed Mariner.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br>Merrily did we drop<br>Below the kirk, below the hill,<br>Below the lighthouse top.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sun came up upon the left,<br>Out of the sea came he!<br>And he shone bright, and on the right<br>Went down into the sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Higher and higher every day,<br>Till over the mast at noon -"<br>The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br>For he heard the loud bassoon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bride hath paced into the hall,<br>Red as a rose is she;<br>Nodding their heads before her goes<br>The merry minstrelsy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br>Yet he cannot choose but hear;<br>And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>The bright-eyed Mariner.
            </p>
            <p>
              "And now the storm-blast came, and he<br>Was tyrannous and strong:<br>He struck with his o'ertaking wings,<br>And chased us south along.
            </p>
            <p>
              With sloping masts and dipping prow,<br>As who pursued with yell and blow<br>Still treads the shadow of his foe,<br>And foward bends his head,<br>The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<br>And southward aye we fled.
            </p>
            <p>
              And now there came both mist and snow,<br>And it grew wondrous cold:<br>And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br>As green as emerald.
            </p>
            <p>
              And through the drifts the snowy clifts<br>Did send a dismal sheen:<br>Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken - <br>The ice was all between.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ice was here, the ice was there,<br>The ice was all around:<br>It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br>Like noises in a swound!
            </p>
            <p>
              At length did cross an Albatross,<br>Thorough the fog it came;<br>As it had been a Christian soul,<br>We hailed it in God's name.
            </p>
            <p>
              It ate the food it ne'er had eat,<br>And round and round it flew.<br>The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br>The helmsman steered us through!
            </p>
            <p>
              And a good south wind sprung up behind;<br>The Albatross did follow,<br>And every day, for food or play,<br>Came to the mariner's hollo!
            </p>
            <p>
              In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br>It perched for vespers nine;<br>Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br>Glimmered the white moonshine."
            </p>
            <p>
              `God save thee, ancient Mariner,<br>From the fiends that plague thee thus! - <br>Why look'st thou so?' -"With my crossbow<br>I shot the Albatross."
