        <p>One of the most important parts of our design is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_system" title="Reputation system - Wikipedia">reputation model</a> that will underpin the system. A reputation model is a way for a user community to collectively regulate and calibrate the contributions of its members. This is a well-established field of study, encompassing many years of academic research and with numerous examples of working systems deployed in the real world.</p><p>Thanks to a generous grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation we are hosting a <a href="http://hypothes.is/docs/repworkshop.pdf" title="Hypothes.is Reputation Model Workshop">Workshop</a>, on February 22-24 in San Francisco at the <a href="http://www.fortmason.org/assets/File/FMC_AmCup_Request%20for%20Interest.pdf">Fort Mason Center</a>, in order to share with and learn from key members of the academic, non-profit, and commercial sectors who research and use reputation systems.</p><p>We'll spend an interactive three days of dialogue and white-boarding, together and in breakout groups, with the objective of providing key insights, feedback and guidance to Hypothes.is in developing our draft design.</p>

        <p>As part of our effort to involve some of the leading and emerging experts in reputation system design and implementation we announced a Reputation Fellows program. Together with the help of advisors Paul Resnick and Nate Oostendorp, we selected ten individuals from over 26 applicants.  We're pleased to announce them, and excited to work with them over the coming year.</p>
